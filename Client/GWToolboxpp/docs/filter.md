# Chat Filter
Toolbox can filter out chat messages you do not wish to see:

## Drops
* A rare item drops for you
* A common item drops for you
* A rare item drops for an ally
* A common item drops for an ally
* An ally picks up a rare item
* An ally picks up a common item

"Rare" means anything with a yellow/gold name, an ecto, or an obby shard. "Common" means anything else.

## Announcements
* Hall of Heroes winners
* Favor of the Gods announcements
* "You have been playing for..."
* "[Player X] has achieved [title]..."

## Others
* Earning skill points
* PvP messages such as "[Skill] was updated for PvP!"
* Nine Rings messages
* Lunar fortunes messages
* "No one hears you..."
* "[Player X] might not reply because his or her status is set to away."

## Custom filters
You can set any messages with specific content to be filtered out. Just type in the content you don't want to see, each on a separate line, and any message containing that exact quote (not case sensitive) will be completely filtered out.
