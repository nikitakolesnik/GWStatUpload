# Trade
The Trade window displays a live feed from [kamadan.gwtoolbox.com](https://kamadan.gwtoolbox.com/), showing the trade chat from Kamadan America English district.

The name of each trader appears as a button, which can be clicked to whisper them.

The Search bar allows you to only display messages that contain your chosen keyword. The Clear button returns the display to show all messages.

## Alerts
The Alerts button opens a new window, containing options for re-directing Kamadan trade chat to your trade channel, wherever you are in game. The first checkbox turns this on or off.

The second checkbox and the text field allow you to only display messages that contain one of your chosen keywords. For example, if you want to buy or sell Candy Corn, you could set `corn` as a keyword to display all messages containing the word `corn`.
