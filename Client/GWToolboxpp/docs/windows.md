# Windows
Unlike [Widgets](widgets), windows are designed to be opened when needed, and hidden when not in use.

All windows have options in [Settings](settings) to specify the exact co-ordinates of their on-screen position, prevent the window from being moved around or re-sized, and to remove the close button.

## General Interface
* `Double click` on the title bar to collapse a window.
* Click and drag on the lower right corner to re-size a window.
* Click and drag on any empty space to move a window.
* `Mouse wheel` to scroll.
* `TAB`/`SHIFT+TAB` to cycle through keyboard editable fields.
* `Ctrl+Click` on a slider or drag box to input text. You can also `double click` on a drag box.
* While editing text:
  * Hold `SHIFT` or use mouse to select text.
  * `Ctrl+Left/Right` to word jump.
  * `Ctrl+A` or `double click` to select all.
  * `Ctrl+X`, `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+V` clipboard.
  * `Ctrl+Z`, `Ctrl+Y` undo/redo.
  * `ESCAPE` to revert.
  * You can apply arithmetic operators `+`, `*`, `/` on numerical values. Use `+-` to subtract.
  
## Opening and closing windows
There are several ways to open and close windows:
* Buttons in the main window.
* Checkboxes in the right of each header on [Settings](settings).
* Chat command `/hide (name of window)`.
* Chat command `/show (name of window)`.
* Chat command `/tb (name of window)` to toggle show/hide.
* The close button on the top right of each window.

## Toolbox window
The main Toolbox window contains the buttons to open each of the other windows (except the notepad), and a button to activate/de-activate auto pcons.

The close button on the top-right of the main window closes the whole of Toolbox.

## Pcons ([more info](pcons))
Automatically pops cons and pcons.

## Hotkeys ([more info](hotkeys))

## Builds ([more info](builds))

## Notepad
The notepad is just a space where you can write (or copy/paste) anything you want, such as complicated instructions to remember. Anything you write will still be there when you restart Toolbox or Guild Wars.
