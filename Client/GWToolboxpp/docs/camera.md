# Camera
Toolbox has several features that interact with the game's camera, allowing you to view the game from different points of view. These can all be accessed via [chat commands](commands).

## Camera Unlock
* Typing `/cam unlock` or `/camera unlock` allows you to freely move your point of view around the map, without moving your character.
* Use `W` (forwards), `A` (sidestep left), `S` (backwards), `D` (sidestep right), `X` (upwards), `Z` (downwards) to move. Hold down the right mouse button to turn around.
* `/cam speed [value]` sets the unlocked camera speed. Normal player move speed is 5.
* `/cam lock` or `/camera lock` to lock the camera and return to your character's point of view.

## Other features
* `/cam fog on` or `/cam fog off` to enable or disable fog.
* `/cam fov [amount]` to change the Field-of-View, or `/cam fov default` to reset it.
* `/zoom [value]` to change the maximum zoom to the value. Use just `/zoom` to reset to the default value of 750.  
 All of these reset to default when you zone.
* Under [Chat Commands on the Settings](settings#chat_commands) are options to lock altitude (so you can only move up and down with `X` and `Z`, and to adjust the camera speed.
