# Theme
Toolbox's appearance can be greatly customized. Many individual features have some separate options for this, but the controls that affect everything are all in the Theme menu in [Settings](settings). Usually it's best to see the effects of these controls for yourself by tweaking them, but you can also read about them here.

It's possible to share all or part of your theme with someone else by copying from the Theme.ini file in the [Settings folder](folder).
